# LIMBY iOS Companion App

**This project is no longer maintained as of March 2018.**

The LIMBY iOS Companion App is the mobile-facing interface for users that own a
LIMBY for their bird. The motivation behind the application is to give bird
owners a way of monitoring their birds health. Many health defects are strongly
correlated with bird weight and thus a bird perch that is able to measure the
weight of the bird can catch early symptoms of sickness. For portability and
usability, the application is made on the iOS mobile platform so that users can
monitor the weight of the bird away from home.
